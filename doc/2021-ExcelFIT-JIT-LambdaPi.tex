\section{Introduction}





\section{How To Use This Template}
\label{sec:HowToUse}

Here will go several sections describing \textbf{your work}. From theoretical background (Section 2), through your own methodology (Section 3), experiments and implementation (Section 4 and possibly 5), to conclusions (Section 6). Instead of such technical content, here in this template we give a few hints how to write the paper.

\section{How To Write the Paper --- A Few Hints}
\label{sec:HowToWrite}

A reasonable way to start writing is sketching the \textbf{abstract} \cite{Herout-Abstract}.  Writing the abstract helps focus on what is important in the paper, what is the contribution, the meaning for the community.  This exercise might take some 20 minutes and it pays back by clearing the key points of the text.
In 99\,\% cases it is very reasonable to stick to the abstract structure \cite{Lebrun2011} which is provided in this template.

Once you have the abstract, it should be very clear what is the message of the paper, what is the newly introduced knowledge, what are the proofs of its contribution, etc.  This is the right time to start constructing the \emph{skeleton} of the paper: its \textbf{comics edition}~\cite{Herout-Comics}.
This thing is composed of mainly four items:
\begin{enumerate} [noitemsep]
	\item \textbf{Sections and subsections.}
	\item \textbf{Figures and tables.}  At this phase, knowing that ``once there will be a figure about this and that'' is just fine.  That is why we have the \textit{placeholder.pdf} image -- see Figure~\ref{fig:WidePicture}.  If this totally generic image can be replaced by some temporary image which still needs more work, but which is closer to the target version, go ahead. A hand-drawing photographed by a cellphone is perfect at this stage.
	\item \textbf{Todo's.} In the early comics version, every section is filled by one or more \texttt{$\backslash$todo} commands and nothing else.  A todo in the text might look like: \todo{you should do something}.  Unlike some elaborated todo packages, this simple solution (defined in the template) does not break the page formatting and it is perfectly sufficient.
	\item \textbf{Phony placeholder texts.}  These help you estimate the proportions of individual sections and subsections and to better aim at the correct paper length. Use \texttt{$\backslash$blind\{3\}} to get three paragraphs of beautiful \phony{grey phony text}.
\end{enumerate}
One hour is usually enough for creating a nice comics edition of the paper.  No reason to wait, make a copy of the template and start butchering it.

Having the comics edition usually lubricates the whole writing process.  Now,
the paper contains 20 or so todos -- why not take the easiest one of them and
replace it with a few lines of text within 15 minutes or even less.  Writing is
no more a scary complex work.
