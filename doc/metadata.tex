   A number of programming languages have managed to greatly improve their
   performance by replacing their custom runtime system with Just-in-time (JIT)
   optimizing compilers like GraalVM or RPython. This thesis evaluates whether
   such a transition would also benefit dependently-typed programming languages
   by implementing a minimal language based on the $\lambda\star\text{-calculus}$ using
   the Truffle language implementation framework on the GraalVM platform, a
   partial evaluation-based JIT compiler based on the Java Virtual Machine.

   This thesis introduces the type theoretic notion of dependent types,
   specifies a minimal dependently-typed language, and implements two
   interpreters for this language: a simple AST-based interpreter, and a
   Truffle-based interpreter. A number of optimization techniques that use the
   capabilities of a JIT compiler are then applied to the Truffle-based
   interpreter. The performance of these interpreters is then evaluated on a
   number of normalization and elaboration tasks designed to be comparable with
   other system, and the performance is then compared with a number of
   state-of-the-art dependent languages and proof assistants.

  acknowledgment={
    I would like to thank my supervisor Ing. Ondřej Lengál Ph.D. for entertaining a
    second one of my crazy thesis proposals.

    I would like to thank Edward Kmett for suggesting this idea: it has been a
    challenge.

    I would also like to thank my family and friends who supported me when I needed
    it the most throughout my studies.
